        *sigh* I promise it has a really good plot. It gets a lot of... attention from certain... communities... BUT a pretty cool edgy-zootopia world built on top of some interesting characters. There's some strange moments for sure, but stick with this one for some cool animation and a nice mystery-based plot.
