        I hated this anime the first few weeks we watched it. I thought the protaganist was a huge douche, and it wasn't until the middle-to-end of the first that I started to enjoy the show. Aliens invade earth, boy saves earth by winning game of tag, wins loving alien wifeâ€”who he hates. Absolute banger of an OST by MAISONdes, btw.
