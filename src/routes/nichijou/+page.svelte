        nichijou (losely) follows three high-school girls, Yukko, Mai, and Mio. Nichijou translates to 'ordinary life', which this anime is anything but. There's not really a continuous overarching story, but rather individual gags and reoccuring characters that are put in exponentially weirder and funnier situations. One of my top shows of all time!
